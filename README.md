# My Custom Oh My Posh Theme

Welcome to my personalized Oh My Posh theme! I created this theme to give my terminal a unique look and feel.

## Getting Started

To set up **Oh My Posh** and use this theme, you can find all the configuration details at the official documentation: [ohmyposh.dev](https://ohmyposh.dev/).

## Recommended Font

For the best experience, I recommend using **SpaceMono Nerd Font** in your terminal. You can easily install it with the following command:

```pwsh
oh-my-posh font install spacemono
```
